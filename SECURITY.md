# Security Policy

Security is very important for Dust and its community. ðŸ”’

Learn more about it below. ðŸ‘‡

## Versions

The latest version of Dust is supported.

You are encouraged to [write tests](https://dust.aoristlabs.co/tutorial/testing/) for your application and update your Dust version frequently after ensuring that your tests are passing. This way you will benefit from the latest features, bug fixes, and **security fixes**.

You can learn more about [Dust versions and how to pin and upgrade them](https://dust.aoristlabs.co/deployment/versions/) for your project in the docs.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, and even if you are not sure about it, please report it right away by sending an email to: praise.godwins@aoristlabs.co. Please try to be as explicit as possible, describing all the steps and example code to reproduce the security issue.

I (the author, [@praise_godwins](https://x.com/praise_godwins)) will review it thoroughly and get back to you.

## Public Discussions

Please restrain from publicly discussing a potential security vulnerability. ðŸ™Š

It's better to discuss privately and try to find a solution first, to limit the potential impact as much as possible.
